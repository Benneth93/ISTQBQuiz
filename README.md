# ISTQBQuiz

This is a pretty simple quiz application I wanted to build while studying to help with remembering appropriate answers for the test this project is named for and track how well I was doing.

Images stored in a SQL database as Base64 just for funsies, although it could have just been stored in a folder somewhere which would have made it simpler.
Images are not included in the repo as their taken from the syllabus and example Q and As from previous exams available on the ISTQB website could be problematic including them here.

The program itself could be repurposed to make other multi-choice quizes
